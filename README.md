I've never typed a .md README file (that I remember) so basically, I think you're supposed to read this

but maybe not

still in progress, basically so far its trying to just take all of the runtime parts of unity's player to make it completely moddable with Javascript so that you can make games and applciations and videos etc. without having to build C# code every time

A lot of credit goes to a bunch of random people, I didn't make everything here, only some parts (in the "scripts" folder mainly)

Pretty much all of the plugins are from other people, the original comments should all be there, with some minor modifications 
to PowerUI to remove errors and fix other things (I don't even remember everything that was modified, but it was definietely some)

Anyways, a full documentation isn't yet ready nor video tutorial, but there is a (pretty brutally complicated) example in the "dugmah"

folder under "achayr" that was used to make this video https://moshiach77d.blogspot.com/2021/01/bh-soul-soil.html

Basically once its running, it sets up a virtual webcam (that i did not make, original author is in comments etc)

that can be installed on windows 64 at least in the "UnityCapture-master" folder (that I just downloaded from the original
author's github somewhere) then once its installed you can stream the unity player output to the webcam (its already set up)
Just go to the Install folder there and click on the .bat

I just made some minor modifications to make it always stream 1920 by 1080 no matter what scale the window is, although all of the
actual heavy lifting was done from the original author

Anyways I made a very basic recorder as an HTML file that simply records the webcam stream, you can adjust the bitrate, the
recorder file is found in achayr --> yetzirah folder here and named "yoytzayr", just click it, then click "ok" to start 
recording the virtual webcam, once the virtual webcam driver is installed, and it should also capture the audio of the
default microphone etc., just look at the source, and once the unity program is started you should theoretically see the 
stream as a 1920 by 1080 video in chrome and if you click the button again it should download the .mp4 video in realtime,
theoretically

For any questions, leave a comment on the above quoted blog post https://moshiach77d.blogspot.com/2021/01/bh-soul-soil.html


Blessings and success
